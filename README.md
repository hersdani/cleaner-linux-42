# cleaner-linux-42
Shell script cleaner for students of _Ã‰cole 42_ where Ubuntu and ftpkg are used.

**Usage:**
You will need to update your firefox_profile_path to work cleaning Mozilla Firefox cache.

Based on Rosie version (https://github.com/BlankRose). I only added a variable for the Firefox profile path and the Google Chrome cache directory.
